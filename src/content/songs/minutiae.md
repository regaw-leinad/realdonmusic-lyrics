If you don’t ask questions

I can’t tell a lie

I don’t give out favors

Like god don’t roll the dice

And so for every twisted narrative inside your head

There’s little things with great effect we know controls more than you realize

Be alert

Be aware

For lesser things of consequence we know can go and hit you right between the eyes

If you’ve not learned your lesson

I can tell you why

I’ll show you your true nature

With data you can’t deny

And so for every twisted narrative inside your head

There’s every bit of evidence below the glow that might come as a Surprise

Be alert

Be aware

For lesser things of consequence we know you’ll oppose

Till’ you can see it with your own eyes

So if you want the scent

Then smell yourself as history repeats itself

Make a deal with the devil in the small details

And what’s trivial in the end reveals

You don’t know yourself like I know whats real

And all the things that you’ve concealed

You don’t know yourself like I know what’s real
