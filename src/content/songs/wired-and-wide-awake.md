"Wired And Wide Awake"

-

From the moment that we were born

And from the moment that we were made

Have agreed to the terms and conditions

Blinders on a horse keep it payin’ attention

So there’s no delay

Cause all they want is cake

To eat your name and likeness like a meal

For heavens sake

They need you all in numbers at the gates

To remake the world in an image without form or shape

I’m wired and wide awake

From the moment that i have sworn

And from the moment my allegiance made

To all and every term and condition

And we’re on our way
