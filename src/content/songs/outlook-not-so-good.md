“Outlook Not So Good”

-

Everything that I’ve got

I had to get it in the worst way

Like waterboarding when you’re thirsty

You’ve got to get your hands dirty

In the world at play

For every bit of beauty

You get bludgeoned all the same

That’s the ying

That’s the yang

And every single day

There’s two opposing forces in civil war inside my brain

And so I brace for impact

And hope I make it back intact

Band-Aid on a fracture

Broke but i’m in rapture

Shaken like an 8-ball sayin’

Outlook not so good

For every equal and opposite reaction

For every fortune a fatal attraction

For every feeling in contrasting fashion

I brace for impact

And hope I make it back intact

Band-Aid on a fracture

Broke but I’m in rapture

Shaken like an 8-ball sayin’

Outlook not so good
