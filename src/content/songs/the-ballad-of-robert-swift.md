Were you awoken by the knocking of the door as they nailed to it The forclosure note?

Was there an abrupt end to your prescription fueled

Fantasies with Johnny Quest and Jack Sparrow?

In milk everyone gets to bathe to their bodies

And everybody gets a taste of honey, then it's gone

And in your waking state the women posted on the wall

Do they talk dirty to ya?

The great white hope

After an abrupt end to your promising career

Do you dream of an education in Southern California?

A winning racehorse gets a blanket of roses

But break a leg and take a bullet to the brain

Somewhere between the ammo holes and animal feces

Among the empty booze bottles and empty rifle shells

Beneath the garbage there is treasure

The greatest gift of all

Rarely seen but it's special

You were a former 1st round pick

Robert come outside and play PIG

I know like me, you're tired of hearing

"You never use your potential"

Don't screw up tomorrow, by fucking up today

Robert come outside for the pure love of the game

I know like me, you're tired of hearing

You never use your potential
