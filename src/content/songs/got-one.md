"Got One"

-

I’ve been thinking ‘bout buying a gun

In the hopes I can tell someone “I’ve got one”

I’ve been thinking ‘bout shooting the shit

In the hope it makes me legit

I’ve got one

I’ve been thinking ‘bout Americans

In the hope I can fit right in

I’ve got one

I’ve been thinking ‘bout taking a hit

In the hope I can live through it

I’ve got one

and I’ve been thinking ‘bout buying a gun

In the hopes I can tell someone “I’ve got one”

and I’ve been thinking ‘bout shooting the shit

In the hope it makes me legit

I’ll push the world to its limit with my love for extremes

I’ll measure my member like 9 millimeter ammunition so don’t you mess with me

I’ve got no duty to retreat

In my pursuit of liberty

I’ve got one gonna tell everyone “wanna see?”

I’ve been thinking ‘bout buying a gun

In the hopes I can tell someone “I’ve got one”

I’ve been thinking ‘bout shooting the shit

In the hope it makes me legit

I’ve got one
