Smoke By Day

-

Looking up above

For some phenomenon

A kind of encounter up the rungs of Jacob's ladder

The meaning of rapture on a flaming chariot

Beyond the clouds and stars with visitors

To never ever return

I'm at the edge of the world with no place to go

Sick of all the same shit, looking for a spaceship

Cause answers no one's got

For the many or the one

Who want to believe but just cannot and views the world as a just a lost cause

Smoke by day, Fire by night

Pave a path like Nazca lines

Prepare a place for an ascension to the heavens

Caught up in a whirlwind to another dimension

At the edge of the world with nowhere left to go

I'm at the edge of the world with nowhere left to go
