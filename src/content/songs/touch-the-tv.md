Hook line and sinker

Reel you like a fish

Have I got your attention?

The subject of every mention

I want to know your need to know me

What clicks to the Nth degree

My flesh a moving picture for everyone to see

So when you touch the TV

You know if feels different

I hear your heartbeat through the screen

And it sounds so dissonant

So even from a distance

I’m close and personal

We all love an intrusion

Total voyeur absolution

I want to know your need to have me

What fix can’t you live without

My flesh a social spook show if you had any doubts

So when you touch the TV

You know if feels different

I hear your heartbeat through the screen

And it sounds so dissonant

There’s nothing like it

There’s nothing forced

So you can feel something inside me and let nature run its course

And you can pay whatever it costs for the experience

That I have made up in my mind and want to bear it some semblance

So when you touch the TV

And you know if feels different

I hear your heartbeat through the screen

And it sounds so dissonant
