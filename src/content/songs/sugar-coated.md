Are you taking toll of the toll that’s being taken

on your body, your subconscious, on your spirit and beyond?

and do you find yourself feeling face down in facades and in fear

somewhere miraculous, post-traumatic, marvel at it but stay clear

I am you and we’re like a snakes tail in its own mouth but it still loves the taste

like its sugar coated to ease the swallow of ideas

like the grass is always greener where dogs defecate

and we move in slow motion some place that won’t wait and we sugar coat it

to ease the passing of the years

have you faced the fact that in the grander scheme of things

we’re all just mounds of shit who don’t deserve to have nice things

and do you find yourself feeling face down extinguished near extinct

somewhere miraculous, post-traumatic, marvel at it but stay clear

I am you and we’re like a snakes tail in its own mouth but it still loves the taste

like its sugar coated to ease the swallow of ideas

like the grass is always greener where dogs defecate

and we move in slow motion some place that won’t wait and we sugar coat it

to ease the passing of the years
