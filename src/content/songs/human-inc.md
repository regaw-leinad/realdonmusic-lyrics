We can be the protagonists

Or we can be your antagonist

We are both the problem and the solution

We'll set the record straight or turn what's black and white to grey

We are both enthused and disillusioned

We can show sympathy for your loss or apathy towards the cause

We represent both the hopeful and the hopeless

From law abiding citizens to Neitzsche's uber-men

We'll uphold the law and get down with the lawless

Always amazed and appalled

Awesome and awful

Human Incorporated

Unfazed yet easily swayed

The animal inside at bay

Human incorporated

Where

"Human is as Human Does"

We growl, but never bite

A tiger can't change his stripes

We can either stray or stay along the lines

Our hands outstretched across the aisle

Or we can see red when we don't see eye to eye

At the same time, we're for utopia and genocide
