Spill to me your deepest darkest fantasies

just know that someone else is listening

and when we’re speaking through space with signals from a satellite

just know that it’s a menage a trois with the NSA

is it exciting or excessive to be violated?

and does my indifference and my disinterest raise alarm?

blow into the whistle and kill the messenger

are you turned on by all the dysphoria?

we can smell sex through the receiver - intercepted and analyzed

as they penetrate penetralia

is it exciting or excessive to be violated?

collateral damage has got us hot and bothered

are you turned on by all of these voyeurs?

we’re all cuckolds for the cut in on our conversation

and they penetrate penetralia

is it exciting or excessive to be violated?
