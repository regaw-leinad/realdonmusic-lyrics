We could be anywhere taking maximum carnage

Plain bread tastes just like sacrament

Brothers, Sisters, Daughters, Sons

Whistling requiem's through the barrel of a gun

There's a white man in black running through a gated neighborhood

Preparatory kids through the window of their school bus

Yell out and holler

"Put us on lock down right away"

A morning jog with two .45's

Tonight we'll pretend it's the fourth of July

Shoot through the door if it isn't someone that you know

Don't go outside to taste the rainbow

Everywhere is not safe at any time

Your freedom and mine is not the same

Just want to barbecue and watch a football game

Even when buried beneath the landscape

Under amber waves of grain

It's not enough to hide my American shame
