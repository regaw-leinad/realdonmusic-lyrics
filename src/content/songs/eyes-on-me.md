"Eyes On Me"

-

I'm vulnerable when in need of some publicity

I'm voyeurable and it is fulfillable, this deep desire to be seen

All of your eyes on me

Just give em' an all exclusive

Obtuse and elusive

Wait till' they get a load of me

Dot the I's in my identity

Cross the T's and don't pass judgment on me

My pretense will soon fuse with the person underneath

I need soul

I need shape

My skull's a luminal space

Too complex to convey

Everything's Mondo Cane

Don't break the kayfabe

Just give em' an all exclusive

Obtuse and elusive

Wait till' they get a load of me

And don't you worry

After my body's buried

The glow of the screen will still burn brightly

For all your eyes on me
