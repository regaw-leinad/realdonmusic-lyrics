I've got tunnel vision on a mirage

misinformation and the barrage

and it's never what you bargained for

your beliefs, your being, your meaning at large

I'm naive and easy

so go pull a con on me

my rendered reality hits like a bolt from the blue

I'm fooled by illusions

prone to delusions too

what fantasies do to you in a fool's paradise

on the dark side of a Kubrick moon

can't affirm your own existence and everything is a complete unknown

on the dark side of a Kubrick moon

falling further into a black hole where everything is a complete unknown

I've got double vision on the status quo

my cognition and the overload

and it's never what you bargained for

your prepossessions, your passions, projections and more

on the dark side of a Kubrick moon

can't affirm your own existence and everything is a complete unknown

on the dark side of a Kubrick moon

falling further into a black hole where everything is a complete unknown
