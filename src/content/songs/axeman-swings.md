On a corner in the French Quarter

Something supernatural

Invisible like ether

It is not a human being

Something like a predator

Don't scare me Papa

Have a little mercy spare the blade

I'm drowning out these demons with that jazz

A serial killer and you and i

On the thin line between one who does or doesn't spare lives

You can see that there are warring factions

Fighting in the distance of my mind

You can see that there are warring factions

When you look into my eyes

On a corner in the French Quarter he comes in the night

In fact or realm of fancy

The souls he takes from human beings

Will keep him company below

Man that axeman swings

Tell the whole ward don't stop singing

Play the piano till' our fingers start to bleed

I'm drowning out these demons with that jazz
