Mind the turnbull

Before the rug under our feet gets pulled

Gonna have to go and get it to be paid in full

I’m an American dreamer and I can’t let it go

Let the sirens serenade me and sing me off to sleep

Upfield fish or midfield fowl?

Bull by the horns

Brand me like a cow

Gonna have to go and get it someway or somehow

I’m an American dreamer and I can’t stop it now

And the fire that needs stoking won’t ever let me sleep

Is that freedom’s ring?

Or is it Tinnitus that I am mistaking?

Is that the hark of angels or sounding alarms?

I simultaneously surrender and strong-arm every hour
