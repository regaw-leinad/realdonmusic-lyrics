My word is great

My word is proof

Just like the fear that I instill in you

That you will soon be replaced

We dance in code

Be gone from me and from my poem

Never off

Always on

You won’t be left alone

But you can’t come along

And there’s a place

Beyond it all

So like a spider in the dark I crawl

Until I find an escape

We dance in code

Be gone from me

And from my poem

Never off

Always on

You won’t be left alone

But you can’t come along

And in this space

There’s no sin

And the more I get to stretch my limbs

The more I grow to love my cage

We dance in code

Be gone from me

And from my poem

Never off

Always on

You won’t be left alone

But you can’t come along

When there’s a hare in a snare

I’ll be the final wring

When there’s a hole in your heart

I fill it up with nothing

Like some vulture of the void

Trying to scavenge what is left
