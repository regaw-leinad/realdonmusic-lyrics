Baby the bar is low

High are the stakes

Why am I so damn hungry

When there’s so much on my plate?

It’s a dog eat dog world

And this dog is inside of a house that’s on fire

But everything is fine

Hakuna Matata

I found nirvana

And I’ve got a rent that is due

Somebody better pinch my arm

Cause I’ve been dying to live out my dreams

And I wish that I knew

How to force quit you

But I’ve got a rent that is due

Somebody better check my pulse

Cause I’ve been dying to live out my dreams

Baby the bar is low

High are the stakes

Why am I so damn hungry

When there’s so much on my plate?

It’s a dog eat dog world

And this dog is inside of a house that’s on fire

But everything is fine

Pass me just like pork

Load the ammunition

I’m a full metal jacket with a candied disposition

A consequence of my conditions

If we’ve lowered expectations

I’m a man on a mission

You need evidence

And I need relevance

It sounds like we’d make a good team

Cause in the land of skunks

The man with half a nose is king
