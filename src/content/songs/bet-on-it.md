You must be confident and calm

Everyday is a parlay so pray that favor is in your odds

Cause if you don’t play the percentage

Fingers crossed for the luck of the draw

Boy you better play ball

When you’re discarded like a burn

You can lay your body across the board and pray for a return

And if it don’t come up aces

All you can do is chase your loss

Boy you better play ball

Everything is more exciting with a bet on it

Boy you better play ball

Or you won’t get none at all

I up the ante every time I cross the street

And if I make it home in one piece it means

I’ve covered the spread today with an edge

Tomorrow we might have to hedge all of it

Been a bad beat, came up empty

So if i make it home in one piece it means
