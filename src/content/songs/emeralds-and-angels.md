Emeralds and Angels



Something's beckoning

"Come take a ride to where the past and future collide,"

"Where all your dreams are made and at the same time

Those same dreams go to die."

The last stand in Eden

The first step into exile

A stranger in a strange land when I've been here all the while

In the great wide open with eyes like diamonds

Through palms and pines

They shine like beacons for me

Emeralds and Angels

You got me torn in two

Hung up on the both of you

Just don't know what to do

Emeralds and Angels

Hung up on the both of you

Something enticing me

Whispering

Faustian ideas into my mind

"Bite the bullet.  Take the cake."

Either way the dice will shake and tumble where they lie

Like a bad omen

There's a strike of lightning

In the palms and pines

There's a fire burning 'round me

"Whatever in possession to surrend."

"Ink is not worth anything to them."

So what are you willing to do for fulfilling?

Emeralds and Angels

You got me torn in two

Hung up on the both of you

Just don't know what to do

Emeralds and Angels

Hung up on the both of you
