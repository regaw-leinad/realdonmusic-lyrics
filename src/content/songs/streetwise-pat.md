I'm taking steps

Through a city in stasis

The sky is as grey as my mood is

Today and every day so come on

Gnaw my nails down to the flesh

The same old characters surface

Don't believe me ask Streetwise Pat, he'll go on and tell you

He's the last one of them left

The others all have met their end

Through some horrific circumstance

Staying alive is as good as it gets for the living

The block's hot like an inferno and so hard hearted it's cold

Pack of hungry humans scrap

To scrape some meat from the bone

It goes

I'm taking steps through a city in changes

It's ghosts are grey like my mood is

Today and every day so come on

The corner smells like piss and shit

The same old characters surface

Don't believe me ask Streetwise Pat, he'll go on and tell you

Pushers and preachers peddling

Different drugs, same addiction

And prey on horrific circumstance

The skies are blue but the streets run red
