For the thrill of it, cause it's inherent

Kindergartners in bullet proof vests

got hard on the feel of IED's on our chests

like white guys with guns on the capitol steps

a Bible, a rifle

an AK and Allah

Redskins get the two-point conversion

an anthem and an image of an Indian

a hog's haven and a black boy

the heaviness of even being

and not knowing what it means

to love a large explosion like a safety with CTE

the twin towers collapse on repeat

mimicked in LEGOS by my jihad baby

to destroy it all cause it's natural

the sounds of Blue Angels or of shock and awe?

when the Super Bowl's decided by the hand of god

but you can't change a mind to what's right from wrong

when the conflict compels

I flee from myself and the intrinsic, internal, infinite inferno within me

the heaviness of even being and not knowing what it means

to love a large explosion like a safety with CTE

to take something so simple and push it to the extreme

the heaviness of being and not knowing what it means

the twin towers collapse on repeat mimicked in LEGOS by my jihad baby
