featuredLyrics: "Set fire to the face of dead presidents"
---

The final factor in a sudden change of opinion

Young boys without precedent

Set fire to the face of dead presidents

The seal of sanity

The answer to 'Why don't they?'

Grown men of every precedent are slaves to the face of dead presidents

Crawl like a snail upon a razors edge

Do anything when you call for me

When the possessor is possessed

The shaming and the smile

The in-between of have and have nots

The current state of my precedent

Is learn to hate the face of dead presidents
