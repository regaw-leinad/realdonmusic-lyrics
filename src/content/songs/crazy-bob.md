"Crazy Bob"

-

increasing absurdity

made me another casualty

of effortlessly being unburdened

I wag this dog when it bothers me

and give in to it so easily

that now anytime when you see me

that dog’s walkin’ me on down the street

am I a villain for not paying attention?

I’m just trying to save myself

I am removed

an active abyss

would it kill you if indeed I got kicks knowing this

my null state

yeah I’m just playing possum

I’m just trying to save myself

I am aloof

at peak crazy

would it kill you to prioritize my own safety?

increasing atrocities

mess with my ability

of effortlessly being unburdened

i used to fight these rules when they’d bother me

but these days i am just more accepting

that now anytime when you see me

I’m smilin’ while I am taking a beating
