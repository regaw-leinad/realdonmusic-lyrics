I've found a new demagogue in demography

cause I am no more than the image you've made of me

I eat my own existence like it's a piece of cake

and there's a special kind of guilt I feel when I finally get a break

I am yearning to be owned while owning nothing of my own

at the bottom of this bucket along with everyone

is where I start to claw and crawl for everything I need

and when I reach the rim it will have been over someone just like me

I talk to you like I'm trying to sell you something

don't you love to treat everyone like another twenty-something

just a vessel for signage

another passing advertisement

i'm content with being content to amuse

I talk to you like I'm trying to sell you something

don't you love to treat everyone like they're on the verge of something

just a vessel for signage

a walking-talking advertisement

I am content with being content to amuse

my enviable life

does it spark delight?

my anxieties a fire they ignite

to meet the demand of perfection from strangers and the like

and there's a special kind of guilt I feel when I finally get it right

I am yearning to be owned while owning nothing of my own

at the bottom of this bucket along with everyone

is where I start to claw and crawl for everything I need

and when I reach the rim it will have been over someone just like me
