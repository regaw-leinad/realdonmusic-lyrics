"Downwinders"

-

we’re all downwinders

we’ll all still feel the effects from miles away

we’re always on alert

near ever present danger everyday

now imagine being under the fallout of something that you couldn’t predict

that’s how it creeps and seeps into your life

without you even knowing it

we’re all downwinders

we’ll never grip the things out of our control

we’re always sufferers

putting the pieces back right after the blow

now imagine being under the fallout of something that you couldn’t predict

that’s how it creeps and seeps into your life

without you even knowing it

i’ve got a deep seated fear of happenstance

i need a sports game just to cope

before sleep

when i’ve woke

i just can’t let it go

how everything could go up in smoke
