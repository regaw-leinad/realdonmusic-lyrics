Born On Inauguration Day

-

in a daring new era

we won’t leave the house

there’s a bold new tomorrow

that will leave you out

and at that singular moment

everybody gets rich

that’s why i do not want to die before my life begins

to maintain this mood and this manner

feels like standing in the midst of a wi-fi wave

i sit inside all day and masturbate to the lemon i was sold at birth

the guarantee of a golden age

feels like standing too close to a microwave

born on inauguration day so i celebrate the lemon i was sold at birth

in the great dichotomy

the first time is free

torches and pitchforks

in a rich mans dream

if you’re compensating

you'll advance & achieve

cause the future is just something that should already be
