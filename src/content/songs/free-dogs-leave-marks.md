Her name is money and she sure ain't free

Free dogs leave marks and claim territory

While shooting my shot I’ll avoid casualties

Cause her name is money and she aims to please

I hear her laughing

I hear her scream

But I can’t tell the difference apart or between

While shooting my shot

I’ll make it routine

Cause her name is money and I have a need

When shooting my shot I’ll beg and I’ll plead

Cause her name is money and I’m on my knees

Whether I give or take the beating

It all just feels the same

So money and I make a master of my domain for one more day

Whether I give or take the beating

I still get whipped in shape

So money and I make a master and servant for you

And I’m cryin’ cause money makes me happy

And I’d be lyin’ to say there’s no effect on me
