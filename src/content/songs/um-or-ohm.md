Here I am

Blood and bone

But the pupils of my eyes look like they’re QR codes

I'm a penny on the dollar

Everything you see’s for sale and because it’s life or death you know we can’t afford to fail

Remember how we used to go and fall in love before we had to go and pay the bills each month?

Here I stand

Skin’s a scheme

And the smile inside my mouth looks like a UPC

I’m a penny on the dollar

Everything you see’s for sale and because it’s life or death you know we can’t afford to fail

Remember how we used to go and fall in love before we had to go and pay the bills each month?

Give me peace

Piece of meat

My whole body is for the sinking of teeth

Sweet release

Rinse, repeat

With piece-meal mouthfuls of me

Whoa what feeling is this?!

Um or Ohm? I don’t know

Getting kicked or kissed?

Um or Ohm? I don’t know

A hit or a miss?

Um or Ohm? I don’t know
