For everything I haven’t done

And all that I don’t know

Wrap all of the answers up in pretty little bows

Cause we all are just God’s creation

But he fears all that he has made

And I need something to believe in

Something to soften the blow

We’re warped after the warning call

Our words are just blah blah blah

You make no sense at all

Today is the day that I delete you
